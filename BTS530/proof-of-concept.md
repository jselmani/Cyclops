# Proof Of Concept

### What Are We Proving  
That raw data can be extracted from the Oculus Rift Headset.

### The Functionality in this POC  
Extracting X,Y, and Z co-ordinate data from the Oculus Rift and writing it into a CSV file once the simulation has started.  The file will be saved and closed upon the user ending/exiting the simulation.

### Data Store  
We are currently not utilizing a data store, simply ensuring that we can write into a file.  Schema's will be designed and implemented in BTS630.

### Assumptions/Exclusions

Currently, the database and the touch controllers are excluded from this POC.
